# OpenCV-like Color Schemes

These color schemes are inspired by the predefined color gradients available in OpenCV documentation. The gradients were carefully extracted from various images provided by OpenCV and converted into RGB format using OpenCV's `cvtColor` function. Each gradient was processed into RGBA values and organized into a format suitable for integration into different applications.

By following OpenCV's well-established color palettes, these schemes offer a familiar and consistent experience for users accustomed to the library's color representations. The color gradients represent a range of hues and transitions, ideal for visualizing data across different domains while maintaining the color characteristics defined by OpenCV.
