# üéß CARA (C Acoustic Representation & Analysis): High-Performance Audio Signal Processing and Visualization Pipeline

**CARA** is a high-performance C library for audio signal processing and visualization, featuring Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Mel spectrograms, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and professional-grade heatmap visualizations. Optimized for large-scale audio datasets, it leverages [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) with wisdom caching, [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) parallelization, and BLAS ([OpenBLAS](https://www.openblas.net/)) for fast matrix operations. The library supports multiple audio formats (WAV, FLAC, MP3) via [libsndfile](https://libsndfile.github.io/libsndfile/) and [minimp3](https://github.com/lieff/minimp3), and offers customizable visualizations with extensive color schemes.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üéß **Audio I/O**  
  Reads WAV, AAC, MP3, and more with automatic format detection.  
  MP3s are decoded via [minimp3](https://github.com/lieff/minimp3); other formats use [libsndfile](https://libsndfile.github.io/libsndfile/).

- üìä **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)**  
  Uses FFTW with wisdom caching to plan FFTs efficiently.  
  Highly tunable: supports Hann, Hamming, Blackman windows, custom hop/window sizes, and frequency range control.

- üîä **Filter Bank Spectrograms**  
  Supports **generalized filter bank construction** using:
  - `F_MEL` ‚Äì Mel scale  
  - `F_BARK` ‚Äì Bark scale  
  - `F_ERB` ‚Äì Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth  
  - `F_CHIRP` ‚Äì Chirp-based scale  
  - `F_CAM` ‚Äì Cambridge ERB-rate  
  - `F_LOG10` ‚Äì Logarithmic base-10 spacing  
  
  Built via `gen_filterbank(...)`, accelerated with OpenMP and BLAS (`cblas_sdot`).  
  Includes optional decibel scaling (branchless) and built-in plotting of filter shapes for inspection and debugging.

- üß† **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)**  
  Computes MFCCs using precomputed DCT coefficients and BLAS operations.  
  OpenMP-parallelized. Supports heatmap visualization with customizable colormaps.

- üñºÔ∏è **Visualization**  
  Renders STFTs, filter bank spectrograms, and MFCCs as high-res PNG heatmaps using [libheatmap](https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/libheatmap).  
  Comes with **130+ colormap variants**:
  - üé® 22 OpenCV-style colormaps  
  - üåà 108 scientific colormaps (27 base √ó 4 variants: discrete, soft, mixed, mixed_exp)

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Benchmarking**  
  Microsecond-resolution timing for STFT, filter bank application, MFCC, and plotting.  
  Includes ranked, color-coded bar graphs and outputs both raw and JSON-formatted logs for deeper analysis.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Performance Optimizations**  
  OpenMP parallelism, FFTW wisdom caching, BLAS matrix ops, and aggressive compiler optimizations including Link-Time Optimization (LTO), CPU-native code generation, and advanced loop transformations.

- üê¶ **Applications**  
  Ideal for:
  - Bioacoustics (e.g., bird call analysis ‚Äî `tests/files/black_woodpecker.wav`, `tests/files/173.mp3`)
  - Machine learning feature extraction  
  - Batch audio pipelines  
  - Digital signal processing research

## üí° Motivation

The main motivation behind this project was to gain a deeper understanding of both **C** and **digital signal processing (DSP)**. While there are countless tutorials on how to **use** MFCCs and Mel filter banks, very few actually explain how to **compute** them from scratch. The process was often fragmented or hidden behind library calls.

When searching for minimalist MFCC pipelines, I came across excellent projects like [rust-mfcc](https://github.com/bytesnake/mfcc), which performed impressively ‚Äî about **2.5√ó faster than Librosa** on synthetic benchmarks ([Colab Notebook](https://github.com/8g6-new/mfcc_rust_bench/blob/master/rust_vs_python.ipynb)).  
However, they often rely on external dependencies and abstractions that obscure what's happening under the hood.

I noticed a lack of **simple, dependency-free, well-structured C implementations** of STFT, Mel spectrograms, and MFCCs that emphasize:

1. **Readability** ‚Äì Code that beginners in C can actually follow  
2. **Educational Value** ‚Äì A step-by-step DSP pipeline laid bare  
3. **Transparency** ‚Äì Each transform is explicitly written (FFT, Mel bank, DCT)

As I built this project, I came to understand and appreciate:
- How **windowing**, **hop size**, and **FFT resolution** interact  
- The inner workings of **Mel filter bank construction**  
- How to derive **MFCCs using DCT**, and why the coefficients matter  
- The performance implications of **memory layout**, **cache locality**, and **contiguous memory access**  
- How small details like **loop nesting**, **BLAS vectorization**, and **data alignment** can drastically affect speed

This project serves as both a **clear, hackable, and minimalist reference** for students, hobbyists, and anyone who wants to learn DSP by building it from the ground up, while also achieving competitive performance with established libraries.

If it helps others demystify the DSP pipeline or write their own from scratch, then it's done its job.

## Performance Analysis

### Benchmark Methodology

Performance comparisons are based on a limited test suite (5 audio files, 0.97-58 seconds) using identical processing parameters across implementations. Results should be interpreted cautiously given the small sample size and specific hardware configuration (AMD Ryzen 5 4600H). Real-world performance may vary significantly with different audio characteristics, system configurations, and workloads.

### Comparative Results vs. Librosa

**Test Configuration:**
- Window size: 2048, Hop size: 128, Window: Hann
- Mel filters: 256, MFCC coefficients: 64
- CARA: Fresh file I/O and decoding
- Librosa: Cached audio arrays (methodological advantage to Librosa)

| Component | CARA Performance | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| **MFCC** | 5-7√ó faster | Consistently outperforms across all test files |
| **Mel Processing** | 1.6-2.7√ó faster | Performance advantage on most files |
| **STFT** | 2-3√ó faster (large files) | Competitive to slower on smaller files |
| **MP3 Decoding** | Competitive-faster | Fresh minimp3 decoding vs cached arrays |

**FFT Performance:**
- Peak: 72.6 GFLOP/s (1.55 Œºs/frame)
- Sustained: 44-70 GFLOP/s depending on file characteristics
- Librosa comparison: 3-4 GFLOP/s (from their benchmark reports)

### Compiler Optimization Strategy

CARA employs aggressive compiler optimizations while maintaining numerical stability:

**Core Optimizations:**
- Link-Time Optimization (LTO) with plugin support for cross-module optimization
- CPU-native instruction generation (`-march=native`, `-mtune=native`)
- Advanced loop transformations (blocking, interchange, unroll-and-jam)
- Automatic vectorization with detailed optimization reporting (`-ftree-vectorize`)
- Interprocedural analysis for constant propagation and function optimization

**Safety Measures:**
- Disabled unsafe math optimizations to prevent NaN comparison undefined behavior
- Stack protection and memory sanitizers in debug builds
- Frame pointer preservation for debugging support

### Performance Caveats

**Limitations of Current Benchmarks:**
- Small sample size (5 files) may not represent diverse audio characteristics
- Single hardware configuration tested (AMD Ryzen 5 4600H)
- Comparison methodology differences (fresh I/O vs cached)
- Limited parameter space explored (single window size, hop size combination)
- Performance results are architecture-specific due to `-march=native` optimizations

**Areas Requiring Further Validation:**
- Performance scaling with different FFT sizes (512, 1024, 4096)
- Behavior with varying hop sizes and overlap ratios
- Memory usage patterns and cache efficiency
- Performance on different CPU architectures and with portable compilation flags
- Numerical accuracy comparison with reference implementations

**Known Performance Bottlenecks:**
- Visualization pipeline (plt:* functions) dominates total runtime (48-86%)
- Parallel efficiency varies significantly (5.7-34.2%)
- Memory allocation patterns not yet optimized for real-time use

### Interpretation Guidelines

These benchmarks suggest CARA's DSP core performs competitively with established libraries under specific conditions. However, the limited scope of current testing means these results should be validated in your specific use case before making production decisions. Performance advantages may not generalize across all audio types, parameter combinations, or hardware configurations.

For production deployments, conduct independent benchmarking with representative data and requirements.
